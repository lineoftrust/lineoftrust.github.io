      <description>Spring Deliverable As part of the University of Virginia&amp;rsquo;s Spring 2017 graduate seminar on Transport Layer Security (TLS), our project team has continued to investigate modern issues surrounding usable privacy and security of web browsing. The Line of Trust project seeks to understand the security, privacy, and human-factors related to a class of phishing and picture-in-picture attacks known collectively as the Line of Death. Contextualizing relevant literature and systematically analyzing the underlying problems in the Line of Death space will contribute to a Systematization of Knowledge (SoK) paper, which we intend to augment with a thoughtful user study.</description>

      <description>Status Update - Week 2 Motivation &amp;amp; Goals User interfaces are vitally important components of overall security, bridging the gap that exists between system designers, security experts, and the end users for whom the systems are being designed. In particular, the user interfaces of web browsers prove vitally important to security given the sensitive nature of content provided by users&amp;mdash;information spanning from banking to healthcare and everything in between.</description>

      <description>Introducing the Line of Trust (LOTr) Erasing the line of death for fun and pleasure
Motivation The Line of Death (LoD) is a class of web browser attacks that target the very pixels of a browser UI on a given webpage, especially with regards to the (presumably) browser-controlled portion of the UI above webpage content.
