# Spring Deliverable
As part of the [University of Virginia](http://virginia.edu)'s Spring 2017 [graduate seminar
on Transport Layer Security (TLS)](https://tlseminar.github.io/), our project
team has continued to investigate modern issues surrounding usable privacy and
security of web browsing.
The Line of Trust project seeks to understand the security, privacy, and human-factors related to a class of phishing and picture-in-picture attacks known collectively as the [Line of Death](https://textslashplain.com/2017/01/14/the-line-of-death/). 
Contextualizing relevant literature and systematically analyzing the underlying
problems in the Line of Death space will contribute to a Systemization of
Knowledge (SoK) paper, which we intend to augment with a thoughtful user study. 
The goal of this blog post is to present the culmination of our work throughout the last
six weeks of the semester and provide a roadmap for our team's plans to move
forward through the summer months.

# Presentation
[Link to the slides (please release as PDF instead, on Speakerdeck, so they can be
viewed by
anyone)](https://www.icloud.com/keynote/0E62QHO05J_Jo5M4Wx3Sm7w2g#Presentation).

Talk about the presentation for a few paragraphs and relate it to what we are
posting below. In particular, discuss the relevance of the Microsoft support
picture-in-picture case study.

# Introduction
Describe a general introduction to the problem and why it needs attention/merits
an SoK. Should be at least a couple paragraphs with sources.

# Systemization
## Overview
Describe the general approach to our systemization (talk about the 6 questions
Bill came up with and why we choose them for our analysis). A couple paragraphs
in total should suffice.

## Paper 1
Perform the systemization analysis on each paper you have read.

## Paper 2

## Paper N ... etc

## Conclusion/Tie-In
Relate the paper's systemizations.

# Project Roadmap
- Discuss our summer plans and November deadline
- Discuss our goals in designing and carrying out a thoughtful user study
- Discuss our goals in polishing/refining our systemization techniques
- Discuss other ideas/routes/directions for the SoK that we want to consider
