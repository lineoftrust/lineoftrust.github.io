# Spring Deliverable
As part of the [University of Virginia](http://virginia.edu)'s Spring 2017 [graduate seminar
on Transport Layer Security (TLS)](https://tlseminar.github.io/), our project
team has continued to investigate modern issues surrounding usable privacy and
security of web browsing.
The Line of Trust project seeks to understand the security, privacy, and human-factors related to a class of phishing and picture-in-picture attacks known collectively as the [Line of Death](https://textslashplain.com/2017/01/14/the-line-of-death/). 
Contextualizing relevant literature and systematically analyzing the underlying
problems in the Line of Death space will contribute to a Systematization of
Knowledge (SoK) paper, which we intend to augment with a thoughtful user study. 
The goal of this blog post is to present the culmination of our work throughout the last
six weeks of the semester and provide a roadmap for our team's plans to move
forward through the summer months.

# Presentation
<script async class="speakerdeck-embed"
data-id="710bc0557e1240d9a9d209d1ed14ddde" data-ratio="1.33333333333333"
src="//speakerdeck.com/assets/embed.js"></script>

Talk about the presentation for a few paragraphs and relate it to what we are
posting below. In particular, discuss the relevance of the Microsoft support
picture-in-picture case study.

# Introduction
Describe a general introduction to the problem and why it needs attention/merits
an SoK. Should be at least a couple paragraphs with sources.

# Systematization
## Overview
Describe the general approach to our systematization (talk about the 6 questions
Bill came up with and why we choose them for our analysis). A couple paragraphs
in total should suffice.

1. What problem(s) does the resource address?
2. How does the problem relate to web browser UI?  If so, how?
3. What solution(s) is proposed?
4. Are the solutions relevant to web browser UI? If so, how?
5. What are the pros and cons of the solutions with respect to security,
   usability, and ease of adoption?
6. [only if viable] Based on the resource, how would you suggest proceeding with
   the implementation of the solution?


## Paper 1
Perform the systematization analysis on each paper you have read.

## Paper 2

## Paper N ... etc

## Conclusion/Tie-In
Relate the paper's systematizations.

# Project Roadmap
- Discuss our summer plans and November deadline
- Discuss our goals in designing and carrying out a thoughtful user study
- Discuss our goals in polishing/refining our systematization techniques
- Discuss other ideas/routes/directions for the SoK that we want to consider
