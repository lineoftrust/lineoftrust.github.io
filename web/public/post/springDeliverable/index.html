<h1 id="spring-deliverable">Spring Deliverable</h1>

<p>As part of the <a href="http://virginia.edu" target="_blank">University of Virginia</a>&rsquo;s Spring 2017 <a href="https://tlseminar.github.io/" target="_blank">graduate seminar
on Transport Layer Security (TLS)</a>, our project
team has continued to investigate modern issues surrounding usable privacy and
security of web browsing.
The Line of Trust project seeks to understand the security, privacy, and human-factors related to a class of phishing
and picture-in-picture attacks known collectively as the <a href="https://textslashplain.com/2017/01/14/the-line-of-death/" target="_blank">Line of Death</a>.
Contextualizing relevant literature and systematically analyzing the underlying
problems in the Line of Death space will contribute to a Systematization of
Knowledge (SoK) paper, which we intend to augment with a thoughtful user study.
The goal of this blog post is to present the culmination of our work throughout the last
six weeks of the semester and provide a roadmap for our team&rsquo;s plans to move
forward through the summer months.</p>

<p>TODO: Add anything else relevant to the project overview and this post&rsquo;s
overview here.</p>

<p><a href="https://tlseminar.github.io/" target="_blank">TLSeminar</a>&rsquo;s mini-conference provided our team
the opportunity to motivate and present our project work during the latter half
of the semester. Our presentation (above) focused on describing the research
problem through a case study of an elaborate picture-in-picture <a href="https://www.tripwire.com/state-of-security/latest-security-news/tech-support-scam-uses-website-elements-spoof-microsoft-support-page/" target="_blank">Microsoft Support Webpage
Scam</a>
reported in March 2017.</p>

<p>TODO: Talk about the presentation and its slides for a few paragraphs and relate it to what we are
posting below. In particular, discuss the relevance of the Microsoft support
picture-in-picture case study.</p>

<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>

<p>The state of web browser client UI today is best described as a disjoint medley of vulnerabilities, contradictory design principles, and implied security conditions.  Apart from the overarching design paradigm of a URL bar perched above page content with a tab-interface situated nearby, almost all aspects of contemporary web browsers vary from one vendor to the next.  There exist no universal security indicators, nor are the relative levels of security—think mixed HTTPS vs full HTTPS—ever explicitly presented to consumers of these products.  Warning prompts, pop-ups, and alerts are all handled differently.  Settings are difficult to find.  Extensive assortments of flags, optional settings, and advanced content featuers are tucked away far beneath the visible surface of the browser interface.</p>

<p>This industry-wide abuse of basic UI principles has resulted in a number of frightening security implications for everday users—issues that have largely gone unaddressed in the security community for the past decade.  Though major vendors like Google (developer of the Chromium project and the Chrome web browser) have taken steps to address some of the more sophisticated UI security issues plaguing web browsers, much more must be done to provide a sense of security for the vast majority of average Internet users who are most vulnerable.</p>

<p>This post is the result of six weeks of brainstorming, reading, contemplating, presenting, and concerted discussion surrounding web browser UI security.  In it, we seek to provide a framework to systematize current and proposed approaches aimed at improving web browser client UI, venturing as far as offering a few suggestions of our own.</p>

<p>Before we delve into that, however, some motivation is in order.</p>

<h2 id="the-line-of-death">The Line of Death</h2>

<p>In January of this year, Eric Lawrence, writing for <em>text/plain</em>, published an <a href="https://textslashplain.com/2017/01/14/the-line-of-death/" target="_blank">article</a> about an intriguing concept he coined the &ldquo;Line of Death&rdquo; that demarcates trusted from untrusted content in a web browser.  Consider the image below.</p>

<p><img src="https://textplain.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/image36.png?w=1440&amp;h=584" alt="The Line of Death (text/plain)" title="The Line of Death" /></p>

<p>As you can see, the page, <em>www.example.com</em>, exercises full control over the content below the red dotted line—the &ldquo;line of death.&rdquo;  Consequently, as a user, you should not trust anything below this line that appears to be imitating a legitimate browser function.  For example, consider a malicious page attempting to redirect you to a spyware site.  The page may generate a fake element that looks like a generic &ldquo;alert&rdquo; box, but since it appears below the line of death, the user should assume that it may be fake and thus refrain from clicking.  As one would imagine, this notion is problematic—<em>real</em> alert boxes actually <em>do</em> appear in the untrusted page content!  How are average users expected to differentiate between legitimate alerts hovering <em>above</em> the browser window and fake alerts displayed <em>within</em> the browser window?  Making matters worse, malicious developers can even deploy JQuery scripts that cause their fake alert boxes to mimic the UI functionality of legitimate boxes—click and drag, &ldquo;cancel,&rdquo; etc.  This mimicry is not limited to alert boxes; page elements such as download prompts, microphone/camera permission prompts, and plugin prompts are all vulnerable to imitation.</p>

<p>We can extend this basic line of death example even further by imaging a scenario in which the <em>entire trusted UI</em> —tab bar, URL bar, bookmarks, HTTPS status—are spoofed within the untrusted content area.  <em>But that would be so obvious</em>, you exclaim!  Well, as we shall see, this so-called &ldquo;picture-in-picture&rdquo; attack is most potent when the user enters full-screen mode, wherein the trusted UI portion disappears from view to provide the user with more screen space.  An unsuspecting user could <em>easily</em> forget that a URL bar should not be present and simply trust the URL bar and security indicators that happen to be dispalyed in the spoofed UI.  For example, in the image below, the entire legitimate, trusted browser UI one would expect to see while visiting PayPal.com is spoofed and displayed <em>inside the untrusted content area</em>.</p>

<p><img src="https://textplain.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/image40.png?w=1516&amp;h=982" alt="Picture-in-Picture Attack (text/plain)" title="Picture-in-Picture" /></p>

<h2 id="certified-malice">Certified Malice</h2>

<p>In a <a href="https://textslashplain.com/2017/01/16/certified-malice/" target="_blank">follow-up piece</a> to <em>Line of Death</em> published only two days following the original article, Eric Lawrence presented another, more insidious browser UI weakness:  malicious websites can just as easily acquire HTTPS certificates as legitimate websites.  This so-called &ldquo;certified malice&rdquo; renders the identification of illegitimate spoofing sites nearly impossible.  In this threat model, phishing sites attempting to masquerade as legitimate sites &ldquo;secure&rdquo; their pages with HTTPS certificates, leading users— <em>generations of whom have been trained to trust the green lock</em> —to believe the malicious site is &ldquo;good.&rdquo;  (We cannot help but point out the obvious irony:  HTTPS certificate proliferation helps the bad guys, too!)</p>

<p>Clearly, this intricate web of UI, security, and social engineering issues necessitates attention to ensure average web browsers do not go astray attempting to check email online.  The two articles referenced above were published <em>less than four months ago</em> and represent the <em>only</em> contemporary inquiries into web browser UI problems.  In fact, it seems that most serious academic work in this area ceased about ten years ago.  This abrupt end to the study of web phishing attacks could mean one of three things:</p>

<ol>
<li>Web phishing is a hard problem with few clear answers, therefore it&rsquo;s difficult to be published, hence the lack of published papers.</li>
<li>No one cares about web phishing anymore.  It&rsquo;s not cool.</li>
<li>The research community has been focusing on other pursuits in the past decade but would certainly investigate these issues if given a friendly reminder.</li>
</ol>

<p>We maintain a firm belief in option #3, and in the potential for future investigation and academic work.  This systematization and roadmap seeks to codify that belief.</p>

<h1 id="systematization">Systematization</h1>

<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

<p>TODO: Describe the general approach to our systematization (talk about the 6 questions
Bill came up with and why we choose them for our analysis). A couple paragraphs
in total should suffice. Just take the six questions below and justify/summarize
them with a few sentences each.</p>

<ol>
<li>What problem(s) does the resource address?</li>
<li>How does the problem relate to web browser UI?  If so, how?</li>
<li>What solution(s) is proposed?</li>
<li>Are the solutions relevant to web browser UI? If so, how?</li>
<li>What are the pros and cons of the solutions with respect to security,
usability, and ease of adoption?</li>
<li>[only if viable] Based on the resource, how would you suggest proceeding with
the implementation of the solution?</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="paper-1">Paper 1</h2>

<p>TODO: Perform the systematization analysis on each paper you have read using our
methodology as described aboce.</p>

<h2 id="paper-2">Paper 2</h2>

<h2 id="operating-system-framed-in-case-of-mistaken-identity-measuring-the-success-of-web-based-spoofing-attacks-on-os-password-entry-dialogs">Operating System Framed in Case of Mistaken Identity: Measuring the success of web-based spoofing attacks on OS password-entry dialogs</h2>

<p>Today&rsquo;s desktop operating systems often use windows which provide scant evidence
that a trusted path has been established when asking users to enter credentials
(<a href="http://people.cs.georgetown.edu/~clay/classes/spring2013/papers/Operating_System_Framed_in_Case_of_Mistaken_Identity.pdf" target="_blank">Bravo-Lillo, C., et
al.</a>).
This paper attempts to quantify the success rate of web-based spoofing attacks
on OS password-entry dialogs. There is a clear connection between this study and
common Line of Death browser UI attacks, as many of them rely on emulating valid
browser- or OS-level elements to trick users into clicking on links or entering
sensitive credentials. The study validates the efficacy of web-based attacks that
spoof OS windows and presents the challenges of a path forward to trust: &ldquo;proving
that a trusted path ritual will resist real-world attacks requires
deploying the ritual into the hands of users who will
be relying on it to do so. The failures of individual trusted path mechanisms
suggest that the problem is unlikely to be addressed adequately
by any single mechanism. Rather, future work may focus
on rituals that combine mechanisms. For example, consider
rituals in which users must first enter a shared attention sequence
and then expect to see a visual shared secret.&rdquo; There remain significant
usability concerns of any particular trusted path implemented, although it is
clear from the study that is Line of Death attacks are highly successful and
readily feasible on unsuspecting users. See our user study design considerations
for further directions inspired by this study.</p>

<h2 id="guardroid-trusted-path-authentication">GuarDroid (Trusted Path, Authentication)</h2>

<p><a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.480.9704&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf" target="_blank">GuarDroid</a>
is a system that protects Android user&rsquo;s passwords from untrusted Android apps.
It addresses the problem of establishing a trusted path between the user and
the service that leverages the smartphone operating system as a trusted computing base.
In relation to web browser UI privacy and security, GuarDroid presents a means
to &ldquo;invert&rdquo; the relationship of user authentication to web sites by keeping the Android
operating system accountable for verifying itself to the user; the user is not
intended to trust sensitive input forms that are not protected by GuarDroid&rsquo;s
application overhead, and only to trust GuarDroid&rsquo;s input when presented with
the secret passphrase set prior to the smartphone&rsquo;s system image configuration.
While GuarDroid is designed to leverage security guarantees for untrusted
Android applications and their form data submission to web servers, the
applicability of GuarDroid to a web browser UI (perhaps executed through a
trusted extension or core browser feature) is analogous to the scope of the Line
of Death attacks we consider. The most significant deterrent to using
GuarDroid&rsquo;s trusted path is the usability need for the secret passphrase to be
a human-readable phrase (i.e., low entropy for a guessing adversary) rather than
utilizing random base 64 characters as the secret for verification. The
advantages of implementing a trusted path, however, are quite effective and
serve as a model of a solution to picture-in-picture attacks from the trusted
base of the browser.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion-tie-in">Conclusion/Tie-In</h2>

<p>TODO: Relate the systematizations and discuss their purpose in our target of
motivating the need for research in the Line of Death class of attacks.</p>

<h1 id="deliverable-conclusion-and-project-roadmap">Deliverable Conclusion and Project Roadmap</h1>

<p>In this blog post, we first motivated and described our semester&rsquo;s efforts
towards the Line of Trust project, using our class presentation slides and a
<a href="https://www.tripwire.com/state-of-security/latest-security-news/tech-support-scam-uses-website-elements-spoof-microsoft-support-page/" target="_blank">compelling case
study</a>.
Secondly, we detailed and evaluated our methodology for systematizing research
literature and community blog posts of significance to
 the Line of Death class of attacks.
Thirdly, we coalesced and analyzed a variety of literature according to our
systematization techniques, and constructed general relationships between the class of
problems uncovered in our literature systematization.</p>

<p>As the semester is coming to an end, our plans for the future of the project
are as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>We intend to continue work on the Line of Trust project during the summer
months, with the goal of submitting a qualitative Systematization of Knowledge
research paper to a conference in the fall term.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="design-considerations-user-study">Design Considerations:  User Study</h2>

<p>Designing a thoughtful user study related to security is not a trivial undertaking.  As <a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.136.5612&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf" target="_blank">Gaw et al.</a> and <a href="http://www.dourish.com/publications/2004/PUC2004-security.pdf" target="_blank">Dourish et al.</a> argue, user practices related to security need to be understood, yet actually obtaining observational data about the nature of user practices is challenging, since security is rarely interacted with directly.</p>

<p>Qualitative techniques such as interviews and surveys can be successful but have a unique array of limitations—namely, participants exercise heightened vigilance and caution and claim to take particular actions with respect to security that may otherwise be totally different outside the interview.  Thus, the issue of <em>unreliability</em> becomes a limiting factor in the effectiveness of interviews and surveys.  Interestingly, <a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.464.9463&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf" target="_blank">Whalen and Inkpen</a> note that in a lab study of web browser security, participants didn’t act to protect data and resources as if they were their own, hinting that motivation is another area of concern in hands-on study approaches.</p>

<p>Lastly, the nature of conducting a study on security practices unavoidably introduces bias into the results, since the evaluator must somehow prime the participant to focus specifically on security, as <a href="http://up.csail.mit.edu/projects/phishing/chi-security-toolbar.pdf" target="_blank">Wu et al.</a> note.  Thus, a good security study must make security a peripheral goal rather than a primary goal.</p>

<p>TODO:
- Discuss our goals in designing and carrying out a thoughtful user study
- Discuss our goals in polishing/refining our systematization techniques
- Discuss other ideas/routes/directions for the SoK that we want to consider</p>
